# About Monopoly Feature

There is a "playable" monopoly game within this application. Whilst near completion, several features such as mortgaging and turn limiting has not been implemented. Thus, you need to be communicating with one another, in order to play adequately.

Visit https://nextagram-shen.herokuapp.com to begin the journey.

## Playing
1. Create an account.
2. Go to your profile page and click on "toggle"
3. Click on the **Monopoly** link in the navbar.

All set!

## Logging in as Banker.
username: Banker
password: Password!

## Things to note.
- Initially all properties are owned by Banker, so only through the Banker's account can properties be given out, at start.
- Content in modal do not update while modal is open :( it is a WIP. So, reopening some modals may be necessary to see updated statuses.
- Resetting the game can only be done by the Banker.
- Chance and Community cards are shuffled upon game reset, and keep their order throughout one playthrough.

Unfortunately there is only one lobby, so other players would have to exit or "toggle" their monopoly status again in order to leave the room.
