# About Monopoly Feature

There is a "playable" monopoly game within this application. Whilst near completion, several features such as mortgaging and turn limiting has not been implemented. Thus, you need to be communicating with one another, in order to play adequately.

Visit https://nextagram-shen.herokuapp.com to begin the journey.

## Playing
1. Create an account.
2. Go to your profile page and click on "toggle"
3. Click on the **Monopoly** link in the navbar.

All set!

Unfortunately there is only one lobby, so other players would have to exit or "toggle" their monopoly status again in order to leave the room.
